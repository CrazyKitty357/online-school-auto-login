**Backstory**
A few months ago my dad told me to wake up everyday for homeschool at 8 AM. I didn't want to do that so I took 4 days out of my life writing this program and it worked for 34 days straight. I have decided to give this power to the people by making this project open source and free to the public. Feel free to fork and make a linux port :)
